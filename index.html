          Financial literacy is a crucial aspect of achieving financial
          capability, providing individuals with the necessary knowledge and
          skills to make informed and wise decisions when managing their money.
          With financial literacy, people can effectively handle their financial
          resources, fulfill current and future financial responsibilities, and
          find confidence in their financial prospects. By fostering financial
          independence, it empowers individuals to take charge of their
          finances, leading to greater well-being and contentment in their
          lives.

          and you'll be in a comfortable position during your later years.

          times, thanks to advancements in technology and the availability of
          various investment platforms. You no longer need to be a financial
          expert to get started; there are plenty of user-friendly investment
          apps and platforms that offer guidance and make the process easy to
          understand. Whether you prefer stocks, mutual funds, or other
          investment vehicles, you can begin with just a few clicks. Remember,
          it's not about knowing everything; it's about taking that first step
          towards securing your financial future. Start small, stay consistent,
          and watch your money grow over time. Your future self will thank you
          for it!

          <!-- Timing The Market & Why Stock Picking Doesn't Work -->
          <h3>Timing The Market Never Works In The Long Run</h3>
          <!-- add a paragraph and then use li to list a few reasons why it doesnt work -->
          <p>
            <em>Time in</em> the market is more important than
            <em>timing</em> the market when it comes to successful investing.
            Attempting to predict short-term market movements and trying to buy
            or sell stocks at the perfect moment is a risky and often futile
            endeavor. Even seasoned financial experts struggle with market
            timing, as it requires accurately anticipating unpredictable market
            fluctuations. Instead, a long-term investment approach, staying
            invested over time, and benefiting from the power of compounding are
            key factors in building wealth. Additionally, picking individual
            stocks can be akin to gambling, as it involves trying to identify
            winners among countless variables that affect a company's
            performance. Diversifying one's investments through low-cost index
            funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer a more stable and
            balanced approach to investment, reducing the risks associated with
            stock picking and increasing the chances of long-term financial
            success.
          </p>
          <p class="not-change">
            Here are a few reasons why market timings and stock pickings don't
            work over the long long-term:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Difficult to predict short-term market movements</li>
            <li>
              Emotional decision-making can cloud judgment during volatile
              market times
            </li>
            <li>Frequent buying and selling can incur high taxable events</li>
            <li>
              Identifying winning stocks is challenging, if not impossible to
              the average investor
            </li>
            <li>Lack of diversification increases risks</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Index Investing</h3>
          <p>
            A better approach to market timing and stock picking is index
            investing. The goal of investing in low cost index funds isn't
            necessarily to <b>beat</b> the market, but to <b>keep up</b> with
            the market. Investing into a low cost index fund ensures you get a
            fair share of the pie and over a period of time this is an excellent
            way to build wealth.

            This passive investing stragtegy involves building a portfolio to
            mirror the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P
            500. This approach is based on the belief that over the long term,
            the market tends to rise, and by investing in a broad index,
            investors can benefit from the overall growth of the economy. Index
            investing offers several advantages, including lower fees compared
            to actively managed funds, simplicity in portfolio construction, and
            diversification across a wide range of assets. It is a popular
            choice for both seasoned investors and beginners looking for a more
            hands-off approach to building wealth while minimizing risks and
            maximizing long-term growth potential.
